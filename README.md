# Quick Reports
This repository contains a conglomeration of various reports that I have created. 
Most of these reports have been created as a product of curiosity to answer a particular analytical question. 
I have done my best to provide clear documentation for each report, including the code file, generated charts as image files, and a short document explaining why I did the study and what I found. 
This repository does not contain all of my work; all of my larger projects will typically have a separate repository.
